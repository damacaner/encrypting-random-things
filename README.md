# encrypting-random-things
Bored to death.
I will encrypt random things because I am bored.
Please also read descriptions because I dont know how to change commit names.

Nothing special for encryption of .pdf, just converts all text in the file to a .docx file, encrypt the shit out of the docx file with Fernet and done. I may also implement add password to pdf so pdf is password-protected and docx file is encrypted with Fernet key. Yeah nice idea.

For encryption of .docx, you can also use AAR69-06 flight crash report but it will be very messy and will not appropiately convert to docx at the start and encrypted file will be like a cesspool. It is still up to you, all PDFs and result output files are there.

For encryption of simple files and image I hugely inspired from Implementing Cryptography using Python Chapter 6. Took my 2 hours but at least learnt something. Arguments are -d for decrypt, -e for encrypt, -g for generating key. I also learnt argument parser and passing arguments from command line and implementing it to code. I love this book.

For tomorrow, I will also implement all files in the folder to the simple file and image encryption. or today, if I get bored to death again.
