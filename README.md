# encrypting-random-things
Bored to death.
I will encrypt random things because I am bored.
Please also read descriptions because I dont know how to change commit names.


For encryption of .docx, you can also use AAR69-06 flight crash report but it will be very messy and will not appropiately convert to docx at the start and encrypted file will be like a cesspool. It is still up to you, all PDFs and result output files are there.
